Problem Statement

Create a desktop application with one window and with 2 sections in it,

1. The first section should display the tweets from any news channel handle,
   showing updated tweets without any event triggered by the user.
   should be live tweets, displaying latest to old in the order.

2. The second section should display any cricket or any match score,
   which is obviously getting updated on every new score.

I hope you understand the assignment, this is going to be a Live application with real results.

- Create your solution and upload it on GitHub and share with us the link to download the exe build,
- Make sure "README" is there to follow the steps to install and see your output.

The timeline is to complete it by 6th March by 9 pm, half submission is allowed with at least one section finished.
Let me know if you have any difficulties or questions
